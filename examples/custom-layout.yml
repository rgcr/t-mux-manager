# Custom layout example
#
# The layout field accepts both named and raw layout strings.
#
# Named layouts:
#   even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-horizontal, main-vertical, tiled
#
# Raw layout strings:
#   Grab from an existing window with:
#     tmux list-windows -F '#{window_name} #{window_layout}'
#
#   Pane count in config must match the layout string.
